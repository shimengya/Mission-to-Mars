# Mission-to-Mars

##This project is taking on the full web-scraping and data analysis for the mission to Mars. We will identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. We will also scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

core skills that youâ€™ve been developing until now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights.
